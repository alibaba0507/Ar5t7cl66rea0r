$ Special Thanks and Credits go to the following people whose code/resources I make 
  use of in MyEditor:
  
  * Matthew Robinson and Pavel Vorobiev: 
    MyEditor makes heavy use of the Layout Manager DialogLayout.java and many code
    tips from their book 'Swing', which can be downloaded freely from
    http://www.spindoczine.com/sbe
    
  * Klaus Berg: 
    For excellent pluggable file history mechanism class FileHistory.java. You can
    read more of how to use it in 
    http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javatips/jw-javatip119.html
    
  * Slava Pestov:
    ColorOptionPanel.java is adapted from JEdit's ColorOptionPane.java by Slava Pestov.
    You can see more of the editor 'JEdit' (which has more commercial strength than mine
    ) and its open source code in http://www.jedit.org/ 
    
  * Davanum Srinivas:
    For wheel mouse support package 'gui', which can be downloaded from 
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmousewheel/
   
  * David M. Geary:
    SuffixAwareFilter, JavaCodeFilter and TextFilter classes are copied and pasted
    here from example 16-5 of 'Graphic Java 2, Mastering the JFC' by David M. Geary.
    
  * Sun's Java Look and Feel Graphics Repository:
    For the icons I used for the toolbar from
    http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/techDocs/hi/repository/
    
  * Photo library from the CD of the book 'Sams Teach Yourself Web Publishing With HTML 4'
    by Laura Lemay:
    The splash screen image is taken from there and edited.
