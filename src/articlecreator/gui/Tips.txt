Tip 0: Start the editor before reading so you know what the tip is talking about. 
 
Tip 1: Use buttons on the tool bar to dynmically compile/run java file that currently
       has the focus.

Tip 2: Open recently used files easily by clicking File menu then choose from a list of
       up to 9 most recently opend files.
	    
Tip 3: More than one java program can be run at the same time with a console window 
       created for each running program. 
       
Tip 4: A running java process can be terminated by clicking the stop button from the
       the tool bar. The process terminated will be associated with the currently
       selected console, not currently selected java file. Toggle between console 
       windows to choose which process to terminate if running more than one java
       process.
       
Tip 5: Use JList labelled 'Consoles:' on the left hand side of the editor to switch
       between different console windows at the bottom of the editor.
       
Tip 6: Highlight and mark a line in file by double clicking the line and come back
       to it latter on by clicking on the item of the JList labelled 'Marked Lines:' 
       on the left hand side of the editor. Another double-click of highlighted line
       will dehighlight the line.
       
Tip 7: There is really no need to minimize any text file in order to see other opened
       files. Just use the combo box near the top of the editor to switch between the
       the files you want to see.
       
Tip 8: Font of currently selected file can be changed by playing around with combo
       boxes and buttons near the upper right of the editor.
       
Tip 9: If the radio button on the tool bar is selected, any font change will be
       applied to the current console window. 

Tip 10: The color of current file/console can be changed dynamically by choosing
        the menu Option/Editor or Option/Console.
         
Tip 11: Double clicking the list labelled 'Marked Lines:' will remove all marked 
        lines of currently selected text file.
        
Tip 12: Define default text format and text font/color by choosing from the menu 
        Option/Preferences.

Tip 13: You can pick up some Swing tricks by studying the source code of MyEditor.	
       
Tip 14: Double clicking a line that contains class name and exception line number in
        the console window will highlight the line first, then a single click on the
        line will make the text file go to the line where exception happened if the
        text file with the same class name as the highlighted line in console has
 	     focus.

Tip 15: The menu Execute/'Run Command' allows the user to give arguments for running
		  java application (e.g. java Test argument1 argument2).

Tip 16: Right click of mouse brings up a handy popup menu in a text file and 
        text field of most dialogs.

Tip 17: Select a word first in file than press Find button from the tool will save 
        you typing the word in the 'Find what:' text field.
		  
Tip 18: MyEditor now supports project build feature. All java files within the same
        directory of the currently selected java file will be considered as part of 
        the project files. Clicking on Build button from the tool bar will compile 
        all java files within the same directory of the currently selected java file.

Tip 19: Column number of current cursor on a text file, displayed in status field 
        is not accurate due to variable tab size of JTextArea. A hard tab with tab size
        3 do not alwasy move 3 empty spaces " " to the right. Please drop me an e-mail
        if you know how to read column number of cursor on a JTextArea correctly.		  

Tip 20: Keep the number of marked lines small (say 1 to 5) by dehighlighting unwanted
		  lines regularly to move easily between useful lines.
